talk.", "cried Jones, highly delighted.", "\"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head.", "Athelney Jones proved to be a  sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the  air of a bon vivant.", "Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.", "asked Jones.", "\"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or  not,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had  a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came  down.\"", "\"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said  Jones, eagerly.", "Jones looked gravely at her and shook his  head.", "\"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.", "Jones  turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the  figures upon her deck.", "Jones yelled to them to stop.", "\"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.", "At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders  into the tiny cabin.", "It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones  was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the  capture.", "\"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land  you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box.", "I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her  last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the  appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the  wild chase down the Thames.", "\"It's a bad job,\"  he repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"", "\"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.", "\"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly.", "Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply  interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their  faces.", "\"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my  friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey.", "\"Well, Holmes,\" said Athelney Jones, \"You are a man to be humored, and  we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and  I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me.", "\"You first, Small,\" remarked the wary Jones as they left the room.", "\"By the way, a propos of this Norwood business, you see that they had,  as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than  Lal Rao, the butler:  so Jones actually has the undivided honor of  having caught one fish in his great haul.\"", "I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit,  pray what remains for you?\""]}]
