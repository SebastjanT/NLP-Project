What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock  Holmes, the specialist in crime?", "As he entered his eyes  fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with  an exclamation of joy.", "\"A presentation, I see,\" said Holmes.", "said Holmes, shaking his head.", "\"Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\" said Holmes.", "\"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the  shores of the great unknown ocean.", "I presume that it is Mr.  Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not ------\"    \"No, this is my friend Dr.", "You interest me very much,  Mr. Holmes.", "Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.", "Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the  interest which he took in our curious companion.", "I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I  recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am  suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary  problem.", "asked Holmes with some asperity.", "I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently ------\"    \"Just a little,\" said Holmes.", "\"I observed it as you entered the room,\" said Holmes.", "Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it  upon his knee.", "Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,  and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation.", "When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he  pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.  Sherlock Holmes.", "\"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more  recent.", "\"Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the  death of Sir Charles Baskerville.\"", "\"I must thank you,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"for calling my  attention to a case which certainly presents some features of  interest.", "Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was  honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and  certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors  were not encouraging.", "Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice  sank almost to a whisper as he answered:--    \"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\"", "Holmes leaned forward in  his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot  from them when he was keenly interested.", "Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an  impatient gesture.", "\"I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these  facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not  wishing to do so.", "\"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears  several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled  order of Nature.\"", "Holmes shrugged his shoulders.",

brought into personal contact with these  things.", "Holmes.\"", "Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.", "Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward  satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.", "Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his  dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe  between his lips.", "\"My dear Holmes!\"", "Chapter 4    Sir Henry Baskerville      Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his  dressing-gown for the promised interview.", "\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to  you this morning I should have come on my own account.", "\"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes.", "asked  Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.", "\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr.  Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is  that takes so much interest in my affairs?\"", "I promise you that,\" said Sherlock Holmes.", "cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his  hands together with satisfaction.", "Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes

 troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?\"", "\"Exactly,\" said Holmes, \"however foolish the incident may seem.", "\"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\" said Sherlock  Holmes.", "\"Your request is a very reasonable one,\" Holmes answered.", "\"And also,\" said Holmes, \"that someone is not ill-disposed  towards you, since they warn you of danger.\"", "There is no devil in hell,  Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me  from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to  be my final answer.\"", "Now, look  here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back  right away to my hotel.", "In an instant Holmes had changed from the  languid dreamer to the man of action.", "Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon  which Holmes did the same.", "Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in  sight.", "said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white  with vexation from the tide of vehicles.", "\"There is no object in our following them,\" said Holmes.", "\"Let me have the Hotel Directory,\" said Holmes.", "Chapter 5    Three Broken Threads      Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of  detaching his mind at will.", "said  Holmes.", "\"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\" said  Holmes to the porter.", "I can take a joke with the  best, Mr. Holmes, but they've got a bit over the mark this time.\"", "Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my  troubling you about such a trifle----\"    \"I think it's well worth troubling about.\"", "\"The queerest perhaps----\" said Holmes, thoughtfully.", "It was in the private  sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked  Baskerville what were his intentions.", "\"On the whole,\" said Holmes, \"I think that your decision is a  wise one.", "asked  Holmes.", "Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise.", "\"No, Mr. Holmes, I have not.", "Holmes?\"", "Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.", "The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I  was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with  which the baronet hailed me as a companion.", "\"And you will report very carefully to me,\" said Holmes.", "said Sherlock  Holmes.", "Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to  Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that  his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some  scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected  episodes could be fitted.", "\"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\" said  Holmes.", "Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.", "Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me.", "\"His name,\" said the cabman, \"was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\"", "So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\"", "\"This very door,\" said Holmes.", "Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and  we followed down Baker Street and along ----\"    \"I know,\" said Holmes.", "Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he said:  'It might interest you to know that you have been driving Mr.  Sherlock Holmes.'", "\"And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"", "John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a  shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.", "Mr.  Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his last  parting injunctions and advice.", "\"It was imprudent, all the same,\" said Holmes, shaking his head  and looking very grave.", "I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind, and  saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and  gazing after us.", "I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had  taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the  crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions  of the assassin.", "Be the answer what it  might, I should at least have something to report to Sherlock  Holmes.", "It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was  clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that  Barrymore had not been in London all the time.", "Holmes himself had said that no more complex case  had come to him in all the long series of his sensational  investigations.", "\"Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"", "If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock  Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally  curious to know what view he may take.\"", "And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the  neighbours upon the moor.", "Chapter 8    First Report of Dr. Watson      From this point onward I will follow the course of events by  transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie  before me on the table.", "MY DEAR HOLMES,--My previous letters and telegrams have kept you  pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most  God-forsaken corner of the world.", "MY DEAR HOLMES,--If I was compelled to leave you without much  news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge  that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now  crowding thick and fast upon us.", "I wonder what your friend Holmes  would do, if he were here.\"", "I am sorry to intrude,  but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not  leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the  moor.\"", "\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not  foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the  moor.", "Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not  disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret the  confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down.", "\"I say, Watson,\" said the baronet, \"what would Holmes say to  this?", "Do not think that it was a  delusion, Holmes.", "Such are the adventures of last night, and you must  acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in  the matter of a report.", "Chapter 10    Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson      So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have  forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes.", "Holmes would not listen to such fancies,  and I am his agent.", "\"Let Holmes know all about it at once.", "I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's  conversation for Holmes.", "I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for  nothing.", "Holmes had missed him in London.", "\"Holmes!\"", "I cried--\"Holmes!\"", "\"I think that I have deserved better at your hands,  Holmes.\"", "Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.", "I was still rather raw over the deception which had been  practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my  anger from my mind.", "There,  sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my  conversation with the lady.", "\"Good heavens, Holmes!", "\"But are you sure of this, Holmes?", "\"One last question, Holmes,\" I said, as I rose.", "Holmes's voice sank as he answered:----    \"It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.", "Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic  outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head  thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.", "Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of  his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.", "cried Holmes.", "I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted.", "At every rise Holmes looked eagerly  round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing  moved upon its dreary face.", "Holmes laid his hand upon him, and held it up again,  with an exclamation of horror.", "Holmes groaned, and  his face glimmered white through the darkness.", "\"Oh Holmes,  I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\"", "\"We must send for help, Holmes!", "I told Holmes how the  matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.", "He looked  sharply from Holmes to me.", "By the way\"--his eyes  darted again from my face to Holmes's--\"did you hear anything  else besides a cry?\"", "\"No,\" said Holmes; \"did you?\"", "\"What do you  think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"", "Holmes shrugged his shoulders.", "Resisting Stapleton's offer of  hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving  the naturalist to return alone.", "Chapter 13    Fixing the Nets      \"We're at close grips at last,\" said Holmes as we walked together  across the moor.", "Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes,  for he had for some days been expecting that recent events would  bring him down from London.", "\"I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\"  said Holmes drily.", "said Holmes, \"he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man  enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his  eyes.", "Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer  seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were  continually fixed upon it during supper.", "I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier  still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.", "\"Good morning, Holmes,\" said the baronet.", "I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that  Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit  would terminate next day.", "The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me.", "Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened  his interview with a frankness and directness which considerably  amazed her.", "Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.", "\"I have come prepared to do so,\" said Holmes, drawing several  papers from his pocket.", "\"Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"this man had offered me marriage on  condition that I could get a divorce from my husband.", "\"I entirely believe you, madam,\" said Sherlock Holmes.", "\"I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\" said  Sherlock Holmes.", "\"Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty  thins away in front of us,\" said Holmes as we stood waiting for  the arrival of the express from town.", "\"The biggest thing for years,\" said Holmes.", "Chapter 14    The Hound of the Baskervilles      One of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a  defect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full  plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.", "The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we were  about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,  and I could only surmise what his course of action would be.", "\"You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes.", "We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the  house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards  from it.", "Holmes asked, when  I had finished my report.", "Holmes's face was turned towards it, and  he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.", "Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the  rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.", "\"We are going too far,\" said Holmes.", "cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking  pistol.", "I was at Holmes's  elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face.", "Then Holmes and I both fired  together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which showed that  one at least had hit him.", "Never have I seen a man run as  Holmes ran that night.", "But the next instant Holmes had emptied five  barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank.", "We tore away his  collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw  that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in  time.", "\"It's dead, whatever it is,\" said Holmes.", "\"A cunning preparation of it,\" said Holmes, sniffing at the dead  animal.", "\"We must leave you now,\" said Holmes.", "There was no light save in the dining-room, but  Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house  unexplored.", "Holmes struck the  door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew  open.", "cried Holmes.", "\"You bear him no good will, madam,\" said Holmes.", "Holmes held  the lamp towards it.", "Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house  while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville  Hall.", "Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the  path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he  could never have set his foot upon firm land again.", "said Holmes.", "Chapter 15    A Retrospection      It was the end of November and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and  foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room  in Baker Street.", "\"The whole course of events,\" said Holmes, \"from the point of  view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and  direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of  knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of  the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex."]}, {"character": "henry", "frequency": 157, "appearances": [" The Hound of the

should go over to sleep there,  but Stapleton would not hear of it.", "Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more  than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the  interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men.", "On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was  there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.", "One would  imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and  yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest  disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some  attention to his sister.", "By the way, your instructions to me never to allow  Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a  love affair were to be added to our other difficulties.", "The Stapletons came  in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley,  at Sir Henry's request, to show us exactly how everything  occurred upon that fatal night.", "I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in  his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he  had received the telegram himself.", "asked Sir Henry.", "\"I could not quite understand the object of your questions this  morning, Sir Henry,\" said he.", "Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by  giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London  outfit having now all arrived.", "I have had a long talk with Sir  Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded  upon my observations of last night.", "Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was  evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat  quiet life upon the moor.", "After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir  Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out.", "Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.", "I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing  anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor  path branches off.", "Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and  were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was  suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their  interview.", "At this instant  Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side.", "What the scene meant I could  not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir  Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as the  other refused to accept them.", "Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a  peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at  Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother.", "He had come to offer apologies for  his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview  with Sir Henry in his study, the upshot of their conversation was  that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at  Merripit House next Friday as a sign of it.", "\"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I  can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning,  but I must allow that no man could make a more handsome apology  than he has done.\"", "We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour  upon his sister's suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a  one as Sir Henry.", "I sat up  with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the  morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the chiming  clock upon the stairs.", "His dark eyes, glaring out of the white  mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he  gazed from Sir Henry to me.", "\"Look here, Barrymore,\" said Sir Henry, sternly; \"we have made up  our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you  trouble to tell it sooner rather than later.", "\"Don't ask me, Sir Henry--don't ask me!", "It is my doing, Sir  Henry--all mine.", "Sir Henry and I both stared at  the woman in amazement.", "\"Yes, Sir Henry.", "Sir Henry  had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our  faces.", "\"I wonder he dares,\" said Sir Henry.", "Any night, for example, our neighbours the Stapletons might be  attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of this which  made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.", "whispered Sir Henry.", "I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.", "And always,  apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in  London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry  against the moor.", "My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans.", "Barrymore  asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in  his study some little time.", "\"I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir  Henry--indeed I didn't.\"", "I  assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary  arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to  South America.", "\"That is true,\" said Sir Henry.", "I know something, Sir Henry, and  perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the  inquest that I found it out.", "\"Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning.", "When the butler had left us  Sir Henry

unprotected,  as a bait.", "That Sir Henry should have been exposed to  this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,  but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing  spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog  which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice.", "She was ready to warn Sir Henry  so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again  and again she tried to do so.", "By encouraging the intimacy he made it  certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit House  and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he  desired.", "She had learned something of the death of  the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the  out-house on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner.", "He tied her up,  therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,  and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole country-side put down  the baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they certainly  would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished  fact and to keep silent upon what she knew.", "\"He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had

paper was committed to my care by Sir  Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three  months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire.", "At the head was written: \"Baskerville Hall,\" and below in  large, scrawling figures: \"1742.\"", "\"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the  Baskerville family.\"", "Dr. Mortimer  turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking  voice the following curious, old-world narrative:--    \"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been  many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo  Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also had  it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred  even as is here set forth.", "\"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history  of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend  to your attention) this Manor of Baskerville was held by Hugo of  that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild,  profane, and godless man.", "It chanced that  this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be  known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held  lands near the Baskerville estate.", "Now, the poor lass upstairs was like  to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible  oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the  words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as  might blast the man who said them.", "'But I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo  Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute  behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at  my heels.'", "But it was not the sight of her body, nor  yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,  which raised the hair upon the heads of these three daredevil  roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at  his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast,  shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal  eye has rested upon.", "And even as they looked the thing tore the  throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it turned its  blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with  fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.", "\"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with  instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister  Elizabeth.]\"", "It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of  Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that  date.\"", "Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:--    \"The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name  has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for  Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county.", "Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for a  comparatively short period his amiability of character and  extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who  had been brought into contact with him.", "It is only two years  since he took up his residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is  common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and  improvement which have been interrupted by his death.", "In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his  personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville Hall  consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the husband acting  as butler and the wife as housekeeper.", "Sir Charles Baskerville was in  the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the  famous Yew Alley of Baskerville Hall.", "Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not  finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been  whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been  difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.", "It is understood  that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still  alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's younger brother.", "\"Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the  death of Sir Charles Baskerville.\"", "I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper  says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to  increase its already rather grim reputation.", "For this reason I saw a  good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville.", "\"On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who  made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,  and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall  within an hour of the event.", "\"I find that before the terrible event occurred several people  had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this  Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal  known to science.", "\"By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry  Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station\"--Dr. Mortimer  looked at his watch--\"in exactly one hour and a quarter.\"", "The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was  Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor  Sir Charles was the elder.", "He came of the old masterful Baskerville  strain, and was the very image, they tell me, of the family  picture of old Hugo.", "And yet, consider that every  Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate.", "\"In your  opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an  unsafe abode for a Baskerville--that is your opinion?\"", "\"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who  is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet  Sir Henry Baskerville.\"", "At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I  will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it  will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will  bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you.\"", "You say that before Sir  Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition  upon the moor?\"", "That is  Baskerville Hall in the middle.\"", "Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we  will postpone all further thought upon this business until we  have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry  Baskerville in the morning.\"", "Chapter 4    Sir Henry Baskerville      Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his  dressing-gown for the promised interview.", "\"This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\" said Dr. Mortimer.", "The address, \"Sir Henry  Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,\" was printed in rough  characters; the postmark \"Charing Cross,\" and the date of posting  the preceding evening.", "\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr.  Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is  that takes so much interest in my affairs?\"", "Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional  interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark  eyes upon me.", "\"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\" said Sir Henry  Baskerville, \"someone cut out this message with a scissors--\"    \"Nail-scissors,\" said Holmes.", "Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest  attention, and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.", "But the practical  point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or  is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.\"", "Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still  visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of  Oxford Street.", "\"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville  has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in  town.", "When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should  have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and  seeing where he made for.", "\"Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\" said the  clerk.", "The book showed that two names had been added after that of  Baskerville.", "As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir  Henry Baskerville himself.", "It was in the private  sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked  Baskerville what were his intentions.", "\"To go to Baskerville Hall.\"", "Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall.", "If absent, please  return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.'", "\"That's so,\" said Baskerville.", "\"At the same time,\" said Baskerville, \"it's clear enough that so  long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people  have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.\"", "\"Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died  unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are  distant cousins.", "The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had  time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it  heartily.", "If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me  through I'll never forget it.\"", "We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph,  and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown  boot from under a cabinet.", "\"And so did I,\" said Baskerville.", "The first ran:--    \"Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall.--BASKERVILLE.\"", "He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry  Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,  conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my  hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message.", "Chapter 6    Baskerville Hall      Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the  appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire.", "\"Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon  the case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville  and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death  of Sir Charles.", "There remain the people who will actually surround  Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\"", "\"And I went to look at the folk in the park,\" said Baskerville.", "Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the window, and  cried aloud with delight as he recognized the familiar features  of the Devon scenery.", "But you were very young when you last saw  Baskerville Hall, were you not?\"", "Baskerville sat for a long time,  his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much  it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the  men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so  deep.", "The coachman, a hard-faced,  gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a  few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road.", "At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of  delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless  questions.", "Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely  around him.", "\"Baskerville Hall,\" said he.", "Baskerville shuddered  as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered  like a ghost at the farther end.", "Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\"", "I fear that we shall never again be easy in our  minds at Baskerville Hall.\"", "My own was in the same wing as  Baskerville's and almost next door to it.", "Chapter 7    The Stapletons of Merripit House      The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface  from our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left  upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall.", "What interest could he have  in persecuting the Baskerville family?", "\"I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\"", "She turned and had  disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while  I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to  Baskerville Hall.", "BASKERVILLE HALL, October 13th.", "Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir  Henry Baskerville.", "He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the  very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the  legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin.", "Chapter 9    (Second Report of Dr. Watson)    THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR    BASKERVILLE HALL, Oct. 15th.", "A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which  flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also  to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of  Baskerville Hall.", "In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist, the  two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees.", "It means no  good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall  be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servants  are ready to take over the Hall.\"", "I start then from the  day which succeeded that upon which I had established two facts  of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of Coombe  Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made an  appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his  death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be  found among the stone huts upon the hill-side.", "If it were not  for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I  might have starved for all that my father cared.\"", "\"It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come  here to see you.\"", "I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton  his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore  the impress of truth upon it.", "It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been  to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be  necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to  Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning.", "There  were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur  of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen.", "Your place should  be at Baskerville Hall.\"", "And it  shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint  within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!", "Resisting Stapleton's offer of  hospitality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving  the naturalist to return alone.", "I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in  thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.", "\"That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the  West Indies.", "The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is  Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the  House of Commons under Pitt.\"", "The  fellow is a Baskerville--that is evident.\"", "The moment you  arrive

the circumstances which attended the death of  the late Sir Charles Baskerville,\" said he.", "Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house  while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville  Hall.", "My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which  had attended a succession of difficult and important cases, so  that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the  Baskerville mystery.", "Car\u00e9re has blurred my recollection of Baskerville  Hall.", "\"My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait  did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville.", "He  was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir  Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,  where he was said to have died unmarried.", "His first act was to establish  himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second  was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and  with the neighbours.", "\"So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville.", "In any case he would very soon learn it from  his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all  details about the arrival of Henry Baskerville.", "From his knowledge of our rooms  and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am  inclined to think that Stapleton's career of crime has been by no  means limited to
