SHERLOCK HOLMES,--    \"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,  off the Brixton Road.", "\"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at  last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.", "I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the  house and plunged into a study of the mystery.", "Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically.", "asked Sherlock Holmes.", "Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling  at my heart which the presence of death inspires.", "Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it  intently.", "observed Holmes.", "Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make  some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we  were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,  rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.", "It's all very well for  you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.", "They evidently  failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that  Sherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some  definite and practical end.", "Holmes took a note of the address.", "\"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off.", "Sherlock  Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a  long

she was gone and rushed into  his room.", "The hall door had  hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.", "said Sherlock Holmes, sharply.", "I  left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the  watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,  and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he  had set himself to unravel.", "Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and  they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.", "cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little  scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes.", "\"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than  out of a dozen of the force,\" Holmes remarked.", "\"My dear fellow,\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,  \"congratulate me!", "Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.", "You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both  brain-workers.\"", "\"You do me too much honour,\" said Holmes, gravely.", "\"Yes,\" said Holmes; \"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\"", "\"To a great mind, nothing is little,\" remarked Holmes, sententiously.", "murmured Sherlock Holmes.", "You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your  nerves.", "\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn.", "\"Very,\" said Holmes.", "said Holmes in an encouraging voice.", "He had evidently come with the intention of consulting  with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be  embarrassed and put out.", "I  stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his  brows drawn down over his eyes.", "\"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\" Holmes observed.", "\"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\"  remarked Holmes.", "I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,  even before Sherlock Holmes answered.", "I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which  tallied so exactly with his own.", "Holmes asked.", "Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.", "\"Give them here,\" said Holmes.", "\"Precisely so,\" answered Holmes.", "\"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing his  penknife he suited the action to the word.", "Sherlock  Holmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in  silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling  effect.", "Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without  result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared  upon his features.", "Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his  forehead.", "\"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you failed  at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single  real clue which was presented to you.", "\"Look here, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart  man, and that you have your own methods of working.", "Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution.", "\"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly.", "\"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling.", "At that instant there was a sharp click, the  jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.", "I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes'  triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's  dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had  appeared as if by magic upon his wrists.", "Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,  the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled  himself through the window.", "Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but  before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon  him like so many staghounds.", "\"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes.", "\"I guess you're going to take  me to the police-station,\" he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.", "Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this  proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at  his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles.", "\"You had better come with me,\" said Holmes to the two detectives.", "\"There is only one point on which I should like a little more  information,\" Sherlock Holmes said at last.", "\"Not a doubt of that,\" said Holmes heartily.", "\"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\" Holmes remarked, as  we chatted it over next evening.", "\"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\" said Sherlock  Holmes, smiling at my surprise.", "The man was  apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes,  who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective  line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some  degree of their skill.", "cried Sherlock Holmes with a  laugh."], "appearances_scores":

both been in the party that followed  them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the  best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was  the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him.", "On  another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder  crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing  himself upon his face.", "Among these had been  Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.", "Rumour  reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his  property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his  companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor.", "It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,  had recognized the vagrant in the street, and

his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he  would soon rejoin him.", "Drebber answered that the  matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone.", "On that the Secretary gave it up  as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last  train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber  answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made  his way out of the station.", "How to get Drebber to that house  was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.", "Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of  whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen  before.", "This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to  the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half  across the road.", "He was so hot that I think he would  have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away  down the road as fast as his legs would carry him.", "When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber  all huddled together in a drunken sleep.", "'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I  continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my
